Layercake Template Sveltekit Test
===

> test repo for integrating layercake into sveltekit

This is a demo of the [server-side annotated column chart](https://layercake.graphics/example-ssr/Column). It seems to work. If you do `npm run build` and disable javascript, the columns and annotations appear. If you enable javascript, the swoopy arrows get hydrated in.

Please raise any issues here: https://github.com/mhkeller/layercake/issues/41
